# Indy Node Container

[![Building All Containers](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node-container/actions/workflows/build-all.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node-container/actions/workflows/build-all.yml)

This repository aims to provide easy-to-use containers with minimal dependencies to run instances of [Hyperledger Indy Node](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node). The primary goal is to support stewards joining an existing Network, but of course the containers can also be used in a stand alone (local/test/...) network. The initial contributions stem from the Container Working Group of [ID Union](https://github.com/IDunion). The repository was contributed to Hyperledger in 2022-02.

Primary artifact are the container images for

- [Indy Node](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node-container/pkgs/container/indy-node-container%2Findy_node)
- and the [Indy Node Controller](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node-container/pkgs/container/indy-node-container%2Findy_node_controller)
 which are build from the files in [the build folder](build/).

We also provide a few [utility scripts, including a docker-compose file](run/) to help setting up a run time environment for the containers.
See [here](run/) for instructions how to setup and run the indy node images from this repository.

## Images

Currently we are providing the following stable indy node images. All those images use the latest Indy Node 1.12 version. The images differ by base image and are tagged accordingly:

- [Ubuntu 16](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node-container/pkgs/container/indy-node-container%2Findy_node/39147763?tag=latest-ubuntu16) :warning: 
    - This image is **deprecated**. We will soon remove the image build from the CD pipeline. Please change to one of the other stable images.
- [Ubuntu 18](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node-container/pkgs/container/indy-node-container%2Findy_node/39147763?tag=latest-ubuntu18)
- [Debian Buster 10](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node-container/pkgs/container/indy-node-container%2Findy_node/37273284?tag=latest-buster) :warning: 
    - :warning: This image is **deprecated.** We will soon remove the image build from the CD pipeline. Please change to one of the other stable images.
- [Debian Bullseye 11](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node-container/pkgs/container/indy-node-container%2Findy_node/37273284?tag=latest-bullseye)

Additionally, we build an experimental image for Indy node 1.13 RC testing:

- [Ubuntu 20](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node-container/pkgs/container/indy-node-container%2Findy_node/39147691?tag=latest-ubuntu20)

See [here](run/) for instructions how to setup and run the images.

## Building

To build the node image you can use `docker` from the project root like

```bash
docker build -f "build/Dockerfile.ubuntu18" -t indy-node-container/indy_node:ubuntu18 ./build
```

or you can use `make` which provides some shortcuts

```bash
# make [bullseye|buster|ubuntu16|ubuntu18|ubuntu20|all|controller] (default is ubuntu18), e.g.
make ubuntu18

# make clean removes images
# make [clean|clean_bullseye|clean_buster|clean_ubuntu16|clean_ubuntu18|clean_ubuntu20|clean_controller], e.g. this removes all images
make clean
```

Please note that `make` generates different tags than the Github action (see [packages](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node-container/pkgs/container/indy-node-container%2Findy_node) vs. [Makefile](./Makefile)).

If you have [trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy) installed, you can use the make check_* targets to run a trivy check against the local images:

```bash
#make [check_bullseye|check_buster|check_ubuntu16|check_ubuntu18|check_ubuntu20|check_controller], e.g.
make check_ubuntu18
```

Trivy HTML reports are created in `./trivy-reports`.
